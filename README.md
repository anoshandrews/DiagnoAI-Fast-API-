# Project Documentation

## Overview

This project leverages a combination of modern AI and web technologies to build a medical diagnosis assistant. It integrates large language models, image analysis, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to process and analyze medical data efficiently.

## Technologies Used

### 1. FastAPI  
FastAPI is a high-performance web framework used to build the backend of this application. It provides automatic OpenAPI documentation, type safety, and asynchronous request handling.

### 2. Uvicorn  
Uvicorn is an ASGI server used to run FastAPI applications. It is lightweight and built on `uvloop` and `httptools` for fast performance.

### 3. Streamlit  
Streamlit is used for the frontend, providing an easy way to build interactive web applications for visualizing and interacting with medical data.

### 4. ChromaDB  
ChromaDB is a vector database used for storing and retrieving medical records in an optimized way. It enables efficient search and retrieval of relevant medical information using embeddings.

### 5. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)  
RAG is implemented to enhance the language model's responses by integrating real-time, contextually relevant data from ChromaDB.

### 6. Meditron-7B  
Meditron-7B is a specialized large language model (LLM) optimized for medical data. It is used for text-based diagnosis, generating insights from patient records, and assisting in medical queries.

### 7. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)  
A CNN-based model is used for processing and diagnosing medical images. This deep learning model identifies patterns in X-rays, MRIs, and other medical scans.

## APIs & Integrations

- **Hugging Face Transformers API**: Used for loading and running `Meditron-7B`.
- **FastAPI Endpoints**: Exposes APIs for handling text and image inputs.
- **Streamlit Integration**: Communicates with the FastAPI backend to display results in real time.
- **ChromaDB API**: Manages and retrieves vector embeddings for RAG.

## Deployment Considerations

- Hosting backend services using FastAPI and Uvicorn on a cloud server ( AWS, aGCP, or Azure).
- Deploying the Streamlit frontend with Streamlit Cloud or a similar hosting platform.
- Managing database storage efficiently to handle large-scale medical data.

## Future Enhancements

- Expanding the model to support additional medical imaging techniques.
- Improving RAG performance by fine-tuning  AWS, adding a user authentication system for secure medical data access.
